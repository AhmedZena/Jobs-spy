### Adding More Job Sites

The JobSpy library supports additional sites. To add them, edit `/netlify/functions/search_jobs.py`:

```python
sites = ['indeed', 'linkedin', 'zip_recruiter', 'google', 'glassdoor']
```

Available sites: `indeed`, `linkedin`, `zip_recruiter`, `google`, `glassdoor`, `bayt`, `bdjobs`, `naukri`

### Customizing the UI

## Limitations

- **Rate Limiting**: LinkedIn may rate-limit after ~10 pages with single IP
- **Scraping Restrictions**: Some sites may block requests; use responsibly
- **Netlify Function Timeout**: Free tier has 10-second timeout for serverless functions
- **Build Time**: Initial deployment may take 2-3 minutes

## Troubleshooting

### Jobs not loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Netlify function logs in dashboard
- Ensure `requirements.txt` dependencies are installed

### Rate limiting issues
- Reduce `results_wanted` parameter
- Increase `hours_old` to get cached results
- Wait a few minutes between searches

### Deployment fails
- Verify Python version is 3.11+ in `runtime.txt`
- Check that all files are committed to Git
- Review Netlify build logs for specific errors

## Privacy & Data

- No user data is sent to external servers (except job sites)
- Applied jobs are stored locally in browser localStorage
